### 🧪 About Me

I am a PhD scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Indore, working under the supervision of **Prof. Biswarup Pathak**. My research lies at the interface of **quantum mechanics**, **machine learning**, and **materials informatics**, with a focus on **thermoelectrics**, **phonon transport**, and **heterogeneous catalysis**.

### 🔬 Research Focus

- 🎯 Engineering materials for extreme ends of **thermal conductivity**
- 🔥 Understanding **anharmonic phonon scattering** and **low κ-lattice materials**
- ⚛️ High-throughput screening for **thermoelectrics and catalysts**
- 🧠 Integration of **DFT** and **ML** methods for property prediction
- 🧪 Descriptor-based analysis of **electrocatalytic reactions** (ORR, CO₂RR)

---

### ⚗️ Catalysis Research

I work on **heterogeneous electrocatalysis**, especially the **oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)** and **CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR)**, using:
- **DFT + ML** for active site identification and novel descriptor engineering
- Reaction pathway analysis for intermediates 
- Structure–activity relationship modeling
